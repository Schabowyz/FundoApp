# FundoApp is a web app project for menagement of employee welfare budget.
 Main goal of the application is to allow users for creation of organizations where their emploees gather and vote on their favourite ideas with part of the employee budget each month.
 Each employee gets number of tokens selected by organizations owner and then each tokens value is calculated based on monthly budged. This allows employees to easily distibute their tokens among their favourites. Then if target or targets are reached, they get completed status and rest of the targets goes through to next months voting.

 Technologies used in application:
 - python with django
 - postgresql
 - google api for registration
 - linkedin api for registration if possible
 - exchange rates api

 My personal goal in writing this app is to improve my django skills, mainly learning django forms, before diving into rest api
